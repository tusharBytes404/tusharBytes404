Hi Everyone!
I am Tushar Bhatia. I am a computer enthusiast and earned my bachelor's in computer science and engineering.
I have worked as a System Engineer and on multiple tools, but I love programming, especially in Python.
So, I have joined this community to learn, contribute and create something valuable. :)
